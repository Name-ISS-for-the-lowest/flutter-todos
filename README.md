# Flutter ToDo demo

Made a todo demo for flutter with backend integration of mongodb.

I am used python instead of java for the backend out of pure laziness since it's just a demo, if you wanna run the project you do need to the pip packages flask, and pymongo, as well as install and run mongodb. I recommend learning to use venv for python.


The app keeps state in the mongodb database so if you the db is running if you hard reload or close the emulator entirely it should have all the todos and their state when you run it again. 

## Another header and stuff

Might write a version of the backend in java later just to complete the proof of concept. Feel free to comment on my code if you think it's garbage.
